longDescription: |
  Nymia is a secure, decentralized desktop chat application that enables peer-to-peer messaging using the Verus blockchain (including all other PBaaS-chains such as CHIPS, vDEX, vARRR). Unlike traditional chat applications that rely on central servers, Nymia uses blockchain technology for identity and message transport, giving users complete control over their data and communications.

  ## Key Features

  - Decentralized Messaging: Messages are sent directly through the Verus blockchain, eliminating the need for central servers
  - Self-Sovereign Identity: Uses VerusID for blockchain-based identity management
  - End-to-End Security: Messages are cryptographically signed and verified to prevent spoofing
  - Privacy-First: Optional local storage with user-controlled data persistence
  - Serverless Architecture: No corporate servers or data collection
